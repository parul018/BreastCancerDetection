Breast cancer is the world's second leading cause of cancer deaths. It begins when cells in the
breast begin to proliferate uncontrollably. These cells typically form tumours, which can be
seen on an X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast. Early diagnosis and detection, on the other
hand, can increase the likelihood of successful treatment and survival. The key challenge to
detection is determining whether tumours are malignant (cancerous) or benign
(non-cancerous). A tumour is considered malignant if the cells can spread to other parts of the
body or grow into them. In contrast to cancerous tumours, benign tumours do not invade
nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body. However, benign tumours can be dangerous
if they press on vital structures like blood vessels or nerves. Despite the fact that successful
detection of malignant tumours from histopathological pictures is mostly dependent on
radiologists' long-term knowledge, specialists occasionally disagree with their decisions. A
computer-aided diagnosis is a second option for image diagnosis that can help experts make
more reliable decisions. In clinical applications for identifying malignant tumours from
histopathological images, automatic and precision classification for breast cancer histological
images are critical. Advanced convolution neural network technology has been widely
employed in biomedical image processing and has had considerable success in natural image
classification. In this work, we propose an accurate and inclusive computational breast cancer
diagnosis by comparing the accuracies of different machine learning and deep learning
models on structured data and histopathological microscopy images respectively. The
machine learning models like KNN and SVM achieve an accuracy of 96.27% and 93.7%
respectively on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Furthermore, three deep learning models
are proposed and analysed. The simulation results showed that our first custom-based CNN
model achieves comparatively lesser accuracy (nearly 70%). The other two models employ
transfer learning techniques of the powerful ResNet-50 and VGG-16 Convolutional Neural
Networks, pre-trained on ImageNet to train and classify the BreakHis
dataset(Histopathological Image Dataset) into benign or malignant. The resultant accuracies
were obtained to be 92.17% and 97.96% respectively.
